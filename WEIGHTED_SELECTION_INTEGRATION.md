# Word Selection Integration Test

## Testing the Weighted Selection System

The new intelligent word selection system is now fully integrated and actively being used throughout the app:

### ‚úÖ **Current Integration Points:**

1. **SessionService.selectWordsForSession()** - The main integration point
   - Uses `wordService.getNextWord()` for primary word selection
   - Falls back to score-based sorting for edge cases
   - Logs score distribution for debugging

2. **FlashcardComponent** - Updates word scores automatically
   - Calls `wordService.updateResults()` on each answer
   - Displays current word scores in the UI
   - Shows learning progress visually

3. **WordsListComponent** - Shows scores for all words
   - Displays `üé≤ X/3` score for each word in the list
   - Supports sorting by score (ascending/descending)
   - Helps users identify words that need practice

4. **Persistent Storage** - All scores are saved automatically
   - Scores persist across app restarts
   - Data syncs with word objects automatically

### üéØ **How to Test:**

1. **Start a new session** - The app will prioritize words with low scores
2. **Answer some flashcards** - Scores will be recorded automatically
3. **Check the words list** - See scores displayed as `üé≤ 2/3` format
4. **Sort by score** - Use the dropdown to sort words by their quiz scores
5. **Start another session** - Notice how word selection adapts based on performance
6. **Check console logs** - See the score distribution for each session

### üìä **Expected Behavior:**

- **New words (score 0)** appear **5x more often** in sessions
- **Partially learned words (score 1)** appear **3x more often**  
- **Nearly mastered words (score 2)** appear **1x** (normal frequency)
- **Fully mastered words (score 3)** are **excluded** from sessions

### üîç **Monitoring:**

The system logs useful debugging information:
```
Selected 20 words for session using weighted selection
Score distribution: [
  { word: "der Hund", score: 0 },
  { word: "die Katze", score: 1 },
  { word: "das Auto", score: 0 },
  ...
]
```

### ÔøΩ **UI Features:**

1. **Flashcard View:**
   - Shows: `üéØ Score: 2/3 correct (correct, wrong, correct)`
   - Displays recent attempt history
   
2. **Words List View:**
   - Shows: `üé≤ 2/3` for each word's current score
   - Sort by "Quiz Score" option available
   - Helps identify struggling words

### ÔøΩüí° **Benefits in Practice:**

1. **Adaptive Learning** - Students spend more time on difficult words
2. **Efficient Progress** - Less time wasted on already-mastered content
3. **Natural Distribution** - Smart but not overly rigid selection
4. **Persistent Memory** - System remembers performance across sessions
5. **Transparency** - Users can see and understand their progress

The weighted selection system is now **live and actively improving** the learning experience across the entire app! üöÄ
