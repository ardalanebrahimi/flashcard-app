# Android Speech Synthesis Fix

## Issue
On some Android devices, the app was throwing an error:
```
ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getVoices')
```

This occurred because `window.speechSynthesis` was `undefined` or `null` on certain Android browsers or WebView implementations.

## Root Cause
The original implementation assumed that if `'speechSynthesis' in window` returned `true`, then `window.speechSynthesis` would be a valid object. However, on some Android devices:

1. The `speechSynthesis` property exists but is `null` or `undefined`
2. The `getVoices()` method might not be available
3. WebView implementations might have incomplete Speech Synthesis API support

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Support Detection
```typescript
private checkSpeechSynthesisSupport(): boolean {
  return (
    'speechSynthesis' in window && 
    window.speechSynthesis !== null && 
    window.speechSynthesis !== undefined &&
    typeof window.speechSynthesis.getVoices === 'function'
  );
}
```

### 2. Null Safety Throughout Service
- Changed `synth` property from `SpeechSynthesis` to `SpeechSynthesis | null`
- Added null checks before calling any speech synthesis methods
- Cached support detection result to avoid repeated checks

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Service initializes without errors even when speech synthesis is unavailable
- Methods return appropriate error messages instead of crashing
- UI hides pronunciation button when not supported

### 4. Better Error Handling
```typescript
async onPronounceWord() {
  if (!this.isSpeechSupported) {
    alert('Speech synthesis is not supported on this device. This feature may not work on some Android browsers.');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of method
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

### ✅ Fully Supported
- Chrome/Chromium on Android (latest versions)
- Firefox on Android
- Samsung Internet
- Chrome on desktop
- Firefox on desktop
- Safari on iOS/macOS

### ⚠️ Limited Support
- Older Android WebView implementations
- Some custom browser apps
- Android versions below 5.0

### ❌ Not Supported
- Very old Android browsers
- Some embedded WebView contexts
- Browsers with disabled speech features

## Testing on Android

### To test the fix:
1. Open the app in Chrome on Android
2. Verify pronunciation button appears and works
3. Test in Samsung Internet browser
4. Test in Firefox for Android

### If issues persist:
1. Check Android version (should be 5.0+)
2. Ensure browser is up to date
3. Check if speech synthesis is enabled in browser settings
4. Try clearing browser cache and data

## Fallback Strategies

When speech synthesis is not available:
1. Button is hidden from UI (`*ngIf="isSpeechSupported"`)
2. Service methods return descriptive error messages
3. App continues to function normally without pronunciation
4. Users see helpful error messages suggesting browser alternatives

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Only adds a few boolean checks
- Support detection happens once at service initialization
- No impact on devices where speech synthesis works normally
- Graceful degradation ensures app performance is unaffected

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `pronunciation.service.ts` - Enhanced null safety and support detection
2. `flashcard.component.ts` - Better error handling and user feedback
3. `pronunciation.service.spec.ts` - Updated tests for new behavior

### Key Improvements:
- ✅ No more crashes on unsupported devices
- ✅ Better user experience with clear error messages
- ✅ Maintains full functionality on supported devices
- ✅ Progressive enhancement approach
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Future Enhancements
- Consider integrating third-party TTS services as fallback
- Add device capability detection and user preferences
- Implement offline pronunciation file downloads
- Add user notification for speech synthesis availability
