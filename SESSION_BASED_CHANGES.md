# Session-Based Flashcard System Implementation

## Overview

The German Flashcard app has been converted from a daily-based learning system to a session-based system. Users now study a specific number of cards per session (configurable: 10-50 cards) and return to the home screen when the session is complete.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Session Service (`session.service.ts`)

**Features:**
- Configurable session size (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 cards)
- Session types: Mixed, New Words Only, Review Previous, Difficult Words
- Session progress tracking (current card, correct/incorrect counts)
- Session completion handling
- Session history storage
- Persistent session state (can resume interrupted sessions)

**Interfaces:**
- `SessionConfig`: Configuration for session size and type
- `SessionProgress`: Current session state and progress
- `CompletedSession`: Historical session data

### 2. Updated Flashcard Component (`flashcard.component.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Replaced daily progress tracking with session progress tracking
- Added session completion screen with summary statistics
- Session-based word navigation (no infinite loop)
- Session control buttons (End Session, Start New Session)
- Progress bar showing session completion percentage
- Card counter (e.g., "5 / 20")

**New Features:**
- Session completion celebration screen
- Real-time session statistics display
- Option to end session early
- Automatic return to home after session completion

### 3. Updated Home Component (`home.component.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added session configuration panel
- Updated "Start Learning" button to show session size
- Session settings with dropdown menus for:
  - Cards per session (10-50)
  - Session type (Mixed, New, Review, Difficult)

**New Features:**
- Session Settings button with gear icon
- Configurable session parameters
- Visual indication of session size on start button

### 4. Enhanced UI/UX

**Session Progress Header:**
- Progress bar with percentage completion
- Card counter (current/total)
- Real-time statistics (correct, incorrect, practice again)
- "End Session" button

**Session Completion Screen:**
- Celebration animation (ðŸŽ‰)
- Complete session summary
- Success rate calculation
- Actions: "Start New Session" or "Return Home"

**Session Settings Panel:**
- Dropdown for session size selection
- Dropdown for session type selection
- Save/Cancel buttons

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Daily-based):
1. User starts learning
2. Words loop infinitely
3. Daily progress tracked
4. No clear end point

### After (Session-based):
1. User configures session (optional)
2. User starts session with specific number of cards
3. Progress bar shows completion status
4. Session ends after all cards are studied
5. Completion screen with summary
6. User returns home or starts new session

## Benefits

1. **Clear Goals**: Users know exactly how many cards they'll study
2. **Completion Satisfaction**: Clear end point with celebration
3. **Flexible Learning**: Configurable session sizes for different time commitments
4. **Progress Tracking**: Better understanding of session-by-session improvement
5. **Time Management**: Users can choose session size based on available time
6. **Motivation**: Completion screens provide sense of achievement

## Technical Implementation

### Session State Management
- Uses Capacitor Preferences for persistent storage
- RxJS BehaviorSubjects for reactive state updates
- Automatic session resume on app restart

### Session Configuration
- Default: 20 cards, mixed type
- Persisted across app sessions
- Easily configurable through UI

### Session History
- Stores last 50 completed sessions
- Includes success rates and timing data
- Available for future analytics features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Session Analytics**: Detailed progress charts and trends
2. **Smart Session Types**: AI-powered word selection based on difficulty
3. **Session Reminders**: Notifications for regular study sessions
4. **Session Sharing**: Compare progress with friends
5. **Adaptive Sessions**: Dynamic session length based on performance

## Configuration Options

### Session Sizes
- 10 cards (Quick session)
- 15 cards (Short session)
- 20 cards (Default)
- 25 cards (Medium session)
- 30 cards (Long session)
- 40 cards (Extended session)
- 50 cards (Marathon session)

### Session Types
- **Mixed**: All available words (default)
- **New Words Only**: Focus on unlearned vocabulary
- **Review Previous**: Revisit previously studied words
- **Difficult Words**: Target words marked as difficult

## Migration Notes

- Existing daily progress data is preserved
- No data loss during transition
- Old progress tracking still available in overall statistics
- Seamless upgrade path for existing users
